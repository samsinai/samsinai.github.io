I'm a PhD student in mathematical and computational biology at the [Program for Evolutionary Dynamics](http://ped.fas.harvard.edu/) and the [Wyss Institute](https://wyss.harvard.edu/) at Harvard. I'm co-advised by Professors [Martin Nowak](http://ped.fas.harvard.edu/martin_nowak) and [George Church](http://arep.med.harvard.edu/). I closely collaborate with, and am mentored by, [Eric Kelsic](https://wyss.harvard.edu/team/research-scientists-engineers/eric-kelsic/). I help in building machine learning and sampling algorithms for efficient protein design. I'm also interested in using these engineering tools to understand and predict fitness landscapes. Early in my PhD studies, I was focused on theoretical aspects of origin of life. I have previously studied computer science with emphasis on computational biology and A.I. at MIT. 

I summarize my research in this blog. You can find more about me (CV, travel, etc) on my [old website](http://www.samsinai.com), sorry I haven't had the time to migrate fully yet:).
