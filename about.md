I'm a co-founder and lead ML scientist at [Dyno Therapeutics](http://www.dynotx.com). From 2014 to 2019, I was a PhD student at Harvard supervised by Professors [Martin Nowak](http://ped.fas.harvard.edu/martin_nowak) and [George Church](http://arep.med.harvard.edu/). During this time, I also closely worked with, and was mentored by mentored by, [Eric Kelsic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelsic). During my PhD, and now at Dyno, I built machine learning and sampling algorithms for efficient protein design.  I'm also interested in using these engineering tools to understand and predict fitness landscapes. Early in my PhD studies, I was focused on theoretical aspects of origin of life. I have previously studied computer science with emphasis on computational biology and A.I. at MIT. 

I summarize my research in this blog. You can find more about me (CV, travel, etc) on my [old website](http://www.samsinai.com), sorry I haven't had the time to migrate fully yet:).
