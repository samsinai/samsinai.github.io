I'm a PhD student in mathematical and computational biology at the [Program for Evolutionary Dynamics](http://ped.fas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard. I'm supervised by Prof. [Martin Nowak](http://ped.fas.harvard.edu/martin_nowak). I also closely collaborate with [Eric Kelsic](https://wyss.harvard.edu/team/research-scientists-engineers/eric-kelsic/) at [Church Lab](http://arep.med.harvard.edu/). I have previously studied computer science with emphasis on computational biology and A.I. at MIT. 

I summarize my research in this blog. You can find more about me (CV, travel, etc) on my [Personal Website](http://www.samsinai.com).
