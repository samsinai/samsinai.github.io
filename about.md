I'm a PhD student in mathematical and computational biology at the [Program for Evolutionary Dynamics](http://ped.fas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard. I'm co-advised by Professors [Martin Nowak](http://ped.fas.harvard.edu/martin_nowak) and [George Church](http://arep.med.harvard.edu/). I closely collaborate with, and am mentored by, [Eric Kelsic](https://wyss.harvard.edu/team/research-scientists-engineers/eric-kelsic/), where I help in building machine learning and sampling algorithms for protein design. I'm interested in using these engineering tools to understand and predict fitness landscapes. Early in my PhD studies, I was focused on theoretical aspects of origin of life. I have previously studied computer science with emphasis on computational biology and A.I. at MIT. 

I summarize my research in this blog. You can find more about me (CV, travel, etc) on my [old website](http://www.samsinai.com).
