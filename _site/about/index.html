<p>I’m a co-founder and lead ML scientist at <a href="http://www.dynotx.com">Dyno Therapeutics</a>. From 2014 to 2019, I was a PhD student at Harvard. During this time, I also closely worked with, and was mentored by, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelsic">Eric Kelsic</a>. During my PhD, and now at Dyno, I built machine learning and sampling algorithms for efficient protein design.  I’m also interested in using these engineering tools to understand and model fitness landscapes. Early in my PhD studies, I was focused on theoretical aspects of origins of life. I’m fascinated by organisms at the boundary of life. I have previously studied computer science with emphasis on computational biology and A.I. at MIT.</p>

<p>I summarize my research in this blog. You can find more about me (CV, travel, etc) on my <a href="http://www.samsinai.com">old website</a>, sorry I haven’t had the time to migrate fully yet:).</p>
