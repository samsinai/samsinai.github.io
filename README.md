## About
I'm a co-founder at [Dyno Therapeutics](http://www.dynotx.com) where I lead the machine learning team. From 2014 to 2019, I was a PhD student at Harvard. During this time, I also closely worked with, and was mentored by, [Eric Kelsic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelsic). During my PhD, and now at Dyno, I built machine learning and [sampling algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10614) for efficient protein design.  I'm also interested in using these engineering tools to understand and model fitness landscapes. Early in my PhD studies, I was focused on theoretical aspects of origins of life. I'm fascinated by organisms at the [boundary of living and non-living](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2016/10/10/what-did-the-earliest-life-on-earth-look-like/?sh=4320acea6f26). I have previously studied computer science with emphasis on computational biology and A.I. at MIT.
