## About
I'm a co-founder at [Dyno Therapeutics](http://www.dynotx.com) where I lead the machine learning team. From 2014 until my graduation in 2019, I was a PhD student at Harvard. During this time, I closely worked with, and was mentored by [Eric Kelsic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelsic) in the lab of [George Church](http://arep.med.harvard.edu/). During grad school, I built [machine learning and sampling algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10614) for efficient protein design.  I was also interested in using these engineering tools to understand and model fitness landscapes. Early in my PhD studies, I was focused on theoretical aspects of origins of life. I'm fascinated by organisms at the [boundary of living and non-living](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2016/10/10/what-did-the-earliest-life-on-earth-look-like/?sh=4320acea6f26). I have previously studied computer science with emphasis on computational biology and A.I. at MIT. I immigrated from Iran, where [I briefly attened medical school](https://qz.com/343467/why-i-became-a-computer-scientist-instead-of-a-doctor/).
