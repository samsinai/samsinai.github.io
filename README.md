## About
I'm a co-founder [Dyno Therapeutics](http://www.dynotx.com) where I lead the machine learning team. From 2014 to 2019, I was a PhD student at Harvard. During this time, I also closely worked with, and was mentored by, [Eric Kelsic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelsic). During my PhD, and now at Dyno, I built machine learning and sampling algorithms for efficient protein design.  I'm also interested in using these engineering tools to understand and model fitness landscapes. Early in my PhD studies, I was focused on theoretical aspects of origins of life. I'm fascinated by organisms at the boundary of life. I have previously studied computer science with emphasis on computational biology and A.I. at MIT.
