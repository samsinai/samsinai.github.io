I'm a PhD student in mathematical and computational biology at the [Program for Evolutionary Dynamics](http://ped.fas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard. I'm supervised by Prof. [Martin Nowak](http://ped.fas.harvard.edu/martin_nowak). I have previously studied computer science with emphasis on computational biology and A.I. at MIT. 

I summarize my research in this blog.
